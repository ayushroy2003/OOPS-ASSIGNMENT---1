    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and prevents the accidental modification of data. It enforces data hiding and helps in achieving data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class can inherit the attributes and methods of another class. It allows for the creation of a new class (derived or child class) based on an existing class (base or parent class). Inheritance promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means \"many shapes\" and refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or message in their own unique way. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, and it is often associated with method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of objects, while ignoring irrelevant details. It involves defining a clear and abstract interface for a class, hiding the implementation details, and focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",

    "\n",
    "ANS - \n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the __init__() function, often referred to as the constructor, is a special method used to initialize the attributes or properties of an object when an instance of a class is created. It is automatically called when you create a new object from a class and allows you to set initial values for the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the __init__() function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: It allows you to set the initial state or values of an object's attributes. When you create an instance of a class, you can pass arguments to the __init__() method to initialize the object with specific values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute Assignment: It assigns values to the object's attributes, making those attributes available for use within the object's methods. This helps ensure that every object created from the class starts with the desired state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: You can define the __init__() method to accept different arguments and perform specific actions based on those arguments, allowing for customization of object initialization.\n",

    "Ans - Inheritance is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), and it allows you to create a new class (called a derived or child class) based on an existing class (called a base or parent class). The derived class inherits attributes and behaviors (i.e., methods) from the base class, promoting code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes. Inheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between the base class and the derived class.\n",
